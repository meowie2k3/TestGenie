This chapter presents a comprehensive evaluation of the \textbf{Test Genie} system, analyzing its performance characteristics, accuracy in generating test files, and comparing it with existing approaches. The evaluation aims to assess whether the system meets the requirements established in Chapter 3 and to identify both strengths and limitations of the implemented solution. By examining metrics related to execution time, algorithmic complexity, and test generation accuracy, this chapter provides insights into the practical viability of using AI-driven techniques for automated test generation in Flutter projects.

\section{Performance Analysis}

The performance of the \textbf{Test Genie} system is evaluated based on two most complex process: AI generation time and BLA algorithm complexity. Others processes are negletable since their time complexity are O(1).
