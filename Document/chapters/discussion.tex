This chapter presents a comprehensive evaluation of the \textbf{Test Genie} system, analyzing its performance characteristics, accuracy in generating test files, and comparing it with existing approaches. The evaluation aims to assess whether the system meets the requirements established in Chapter 3 and to identify both strengths and limitations of the implemented solution. By examining metrics related to execution time, algorithmic complexity, and test generation accuracy, this chapter provides insights into the practical viability of using AI-driven techniques for automated test generation in Flutter projects.

\section{Performance Analysis}

The performance of the \textbf{Test Genie} system is evaluated based on two most complex process: AI generation time and BLA algorithm complexity. Others processes are negletable since their time complexity are O(1). Although DBMS module is dependent on the server's response time, it is impossible to estimate the time complexity of the server's response. However, it is important to note that the DBMS module may become a bottleneck in the overall system performance.

To fully calculate the performance estimation of this system, let the estimation time for AI to generate tests is $T_{AI\_test}$ and the time to fully generate blocks in BLA is $T_{BLA}$. Since the block generating procedure contain two separate steps are source code splitting and blocks's prediction generation, we can define the time complexity of BLA as $T_{BLA} = T_{split} + T_{predict}$, where $T_{split}$ is the time complexity of source code splitting and $T_{predict}$ is the time complexity of blocks's prediction generation. The overall time complexity of the system can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
T_{total} = T_{AI\_test} + T_{BLA} = T_{AI\_test} + T_{split} + T_{predict}
\end{equation}

If we account for DBMS module as a parameter $m$, the overall time complexity of the system can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
T_{total} = T_{AI\_test} + T_{BLA} + m = T_{AI\_test} + T_{split} + T_{predict} + m
\end{equation}


\subsection{Code Splitting Algorithm complexity}

The \textbf{Code Splitting Algorithm} is a critical component of the Business Logic Analyzer module, responsible for decomposing source code into blocks that can be individually analyzed. This algorithm consists of three main subroutines: ImportAnalyzer, ContainAnalyzer, and CallAnalyzer. The complexity of each subroutine contributes to the overall complexity of the code splitting process.

\subsubsection{ImportAnalyzer Complexity}

The ImportAnalyzer function processes import statements in each file to establish connections between files. For a project with $n$ files, each with an average of $i$ import statements, the function performs the following operations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item For each file, it scans all lines to identify import statements: $O(L)$ where $L$ is the average number of lines per file
    \item For each import statement, it creates a connection between files: $O(1)$
    \item It recursively processes each imported file: $O(n \cdot i)$ in worst case
\end{itemize}

The worst-case time complexity occurs when the import graph forms a chain, leading to a complexity of:
\begin{equation}
T_{import} = O(n \cdot L + n \cdot i) = O(n \cdot (L + i))
\end{equation}

In practice, however, import structures in real-world projects often form a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with significant overlap, resulting in an average-case complexity closer to $O(n \cdot L)$.

\subsubsection{ContainAnalyzer Complexity}

The ContainAnalyzer function performs a deeper analysis of each file, identifying classes, functions, variables, and their hierarchical relationships. For a codebase with a total of $LOC$ lines of code distributed across $n$ files, the function:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Processes each line in each file: $O(LOC)$
    \item For each identified block (class, function, etc.), it performs a detailed analysis: $O(b)$ where $b$ is the number of blocks
    \item It maintains state information about brackets, class names, etc.: $O(1)$ per line
    \item It recursively analyzes each identified block: $O(b \cdot d)$ where $d$ is the average nesting depth
\end{itemize}

The overall time complexity of ContainAnalyzer can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
T_{contain} = O(LOC + b \cdot d)
\end{equation}

Since the number of blocks $b$ is generally proportional to $LOC$ (typically $b \approx \frac{LOC}{c}$ where $c$ is the average block size), and the nesting depth $d$ is usually bounded by a small constant, we can simplify this to:
\begin{equation}
T_{contain} = O(LOC)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{CallAnalyzer Complexity}

The CallAnalyzer function identifies calling relationships between blocks, which requires comparing blocks against each other. For a project with $b$ blocks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item It compares each block against potentially every other block: $O(b^2)$
    \item For each comparison, it analyzes the content for references: $O(s)$ where $s$ is the average block size in lines
    \item It performs regular expression matching for each potential call: $O(s \cdot c)$ where $c$ is the average number of callables
\end{itemize}

The worst-case time complexity of CallAnalyzer is:
\begin{equation}
T_{call} = O(b^2 \cdot s \cdot c)
\end{equation}

However, the implementation uses optimizations such as filtering blocks by type and caching results, which significantly reduces the number of comparisons in practice. With these optimizations, the average-case complexity is closer to:
\begin{equation}
T_{call} = O(b \cdot s \cdot c)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Overall Code Splitting Complexity}

Combining the complexities of the three analyzers, the overall time complexity of the code splitting algorithm is:
\begin{equation}
T_{split} = T_{import} + T_{contain} + T_{call} = O(n \cdot (L + i)) + O(LOC) + O(b \cdot s \cdot c)
\end{equation}

Given that $n \cdot L$ is approximately equal to $LOC$, and $b \cdot s$ is also proportional to $LOC$, we can simplify this to:
\begin{equation}
T_{split} = O(LOC \cdot (1 + \frac{i}{L} + c))
\end{equation}

For typical projects, the ratios $\frac{i}{L}$ (imports per line) and $c$ (callable references per block) are relatively small constants, leading to a final complexity approximation:
\begin{equation}
T_{split} = O(LOC)
\end{equation}

This linear complexity with respect to the total lines of code indicates that the code splitting algorithm scales efficiently with project size, making it suitable for analyzing large codebases.

\subsection{AI generation time estimation}

The AI generation process in Test Genie consists of two main components: generating predictions for code blocks ($T_{predict}$) and generating test cases for those blocks ($T_{AI\_test}$). Both processes rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) accessed through API calls, making their execution time dependent on several factors.

\subsubsection{Block Prediction Generation Complexity}

The prediction generation process analyzes each block to determine its purpose and generate testing scenarios. For a project with $b$ blocks:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Each block requires a separate API call to the LLM: $O(b)$
    \item The processing time for each block depends on its size: $O(s)$ where $s$ is the average block size
    \item The time complexity of the LLM itself is approximately $O(t \cdot log(t))$ where $t$ is the token count (proportional to block size)
    \item Retrieval from vector stores adds $O(v \cdot d)$ complexity, where $v$ is the number of vectors and $d$ is their dimensionality
\end{itemize}

The time complexity for prediction generation can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
T_{predict} = O(b \cdot (s \cdot log(s) + v \cdot d))
\end{equation}

In practice, the token count $s$ is bounded by the maximum context window of the LLM (typically 4,096 or 8,192 tokens), and the vector retrieval is highly optimized. Therefore, we can approximate the complexity as:
\begin{equation}
T_{predict} = O(b \cdot k)
\end{equation}

where $k$ is a constant representing the average API call time. This indicates that prediction generation scales linearly with the number of blocks.

\subsubsection{Test Case Generation Complexity}

The test case generation process creates test files based on the previously generated predictions. For each block selected for testing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item An API call is made to the LLM: $O(1)$ per test
    \item The model processes the prediction and code context: $O(p + c)$ where $p$ is prediction size and $c$ is context size
    \item Error fixing may require multiple iterations: $O(r)$ where $r$ is the number of retry attempts (bounded by a constant)
    \item Vector store retrieval for context enhancement: $O(v \cdot d)$
\end{itemize}

The time complexity for test generation can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
T_{AI\_test} = O(t \cdot r \cdot (p + c + v \cdot d))
\end{equation}

where $t$ is the number of tests to be generated. Since $p$, $c$, $v$, $d$, and $r$ are all bounded by constants in the implementation (with a maximum of 5 retry attempts), we can simplify this to:
\begin{equation}
T_{AI\_test} = O(t)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Overall AI Generation Time}

Combining the prediction and test generation times, the overall AI generation time complexity is:
\begin{equation}
T_{AI} = T_{predict} + T_{AI\_test} = O(b \cdot k) + O(t)
\end{equation}

Since typically $t \leq b$ (as not all blocks may require tests), this simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
T_{AI} = O(b)
\end{equation}

This linear relationship with the number of blocks indicates that the AI generation process scales reasonably with project size. However, the constant factor $k$ (representing API call time) is significant and can make this the most time-consuming part of the overall process for large projects.

\subsubsection{Practical Considerations}

In practice, AI generation time is dominated by network latency and the throughput of the LLM API service rather than computational complexity. The implementation incorporates several optimizations to mitigate these factors:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Caching for identical queries to avoid redundant API calls
    \item Concurrent API calls when appropriate to improve throughput
    \item Error fix caching to avoid reprocessing similar errors
    \item Vector stores for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance quality while minimizing token usage
\end{itemize}

Empirical measurements show that for a medium-sized Flutter project (approximately 10,000 lines of code), the average time for prediction generation is approximately 2-3 seconds per block, and test generation takes 3-5 seconds per test. This results in an overall processing time well within the 5-minute target specified in the requirements for typical projects.

\section{Accuracy Evaluation}

The accuracy of Test Genie's test generation capabilities was evaluated through a series of experiments designed to assess both the syntactic correctness of generated tests and their effectiveness in validating the intended behavior of the code. This evaluation provides insights into the system's ability to fulfill its primary purpose: generating valid, useful test cases that accurately reflect the business logic of Flutter applications.

\subsection{Evaluation Methodology}

To evaluate the accuracy of Test Genie, we employed a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative metrics and qualitative assessment:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Syntactic Validity}: We measured the percentage of generated test files that compiled without errors on the first attempt.
    
    \item \textbf{Test Execution Success}: We calculated the proportion of tests that executed successfully after the auto-correction process (limited to 5 iterations).
    
    \item \textbf{Coverage Analysis}: We assessed the code coverage achieved by the generated tests using Flutter's built-in coverage tools.
    
    \item \textbf{Human Evaluation}: Experienced Flutter developers reviewed the generated tests to evaluate their relevance, completeness, and alignment with business requirements.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Test Dataset}

For our evaluation, we selected a diverse set of Flutter projects from GitHub repositories, representing different application domains, complexities, and coding styles:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A simple todo application (approximately 2,000 LOC)
    \item A medium-complexity e-commerce app (approximately 8,000 LOC)
    \item A feature-rich social media client (approximately 15,000 LOC)
    \item A complex enterprise dashboard application (approximately 25,000 LOC)
\end{itemize}

From each project, we randomly selected 20 functions or classes for test generation, ensuring a representative sample across different complexity levels and functionalities.

\subsection{Quantitative Results}

The quantitative evaluation revealed promising results across the selected metrics:

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \caption{Test Generation Accuracy Metrics}

            Enterprise Dashboard & 71.4\% & 83.7\% & 2.6 & 67.3\% & 61.5\% \\
            \hline
            \textbf{Overall Average} & \textbf{79.9\%} & \textbf{89.9\%} & \textbf{1.9} & \textbf{73.0\%} & \textbf{66.9\%} \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}%
    }
\end{table}

Key findings from the quantitative analysis include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item First-attempt syntax success decreased with project complexity, suggesting that more complex code structures present greater challenges for accurate test generation.
    
    \item The error correction mechanism significantly improved success rates, with overall execution success reaching nearly 90\% after auto-correction attempts.
    
    \item Most successful corrections occurred within the first two iterations, indicating efficient error resolution.
    
    \item The average code coverage achieved by the generated tests (73\% line coverage, 67\% branch coverage) compares favorably with industry benchmarks for automated test generation tools, which typically achieve 60-70\% coverage.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Qualitative Assessment}

Human evaluators reviewed the generated tests to assess their quality across several dimensions. Each test was rated on a scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) for the following criteria:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Relevance}: How well the test addresses the actual functionality of the code
    \item \textbf{Comprehensiveness}: Whether the test covers the full range of functionality, including edge cases
    \item \textbf{Readability}: How easy it is to understand the purpose and structure of the test
    \item \textbf{Maintainability}: How well the test would adapt to future code changes
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \caption{Human Evaluation of Generated Tests (Scale: 1-5)}
    \label{tab:human-evaluation}
    \begin{tabular}{lcccc}
        \hline
        \textbf{Project Type} & \textbf{Relevance} & \textbf{Comprehensiveness} & \textbf{Readability} & \textbf{Maintainability} \\ \hline
        Todo App & 4.3 & 3.8 & 4.5 & 4.1 \\
        E-commerce App & 4.1 & 3.7 & 4.3 & 3.9 \\
        Social Media Client & 3.8 & 3.4 & 4.2 & 3.7 \\
        Enterprise Dashboard & 3.5 & 3.2 & 4.0 & 3.5 \\
        \hline
        \textbf{Overall Average} & \textbf{3.9} & \textbf{3.5} & \textbf{4.3} & \textbf{3.8} \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The human evaluation revealed several interesting insights:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Tests consistently scored highest on readability (4.3), indicating that the generated tests were well-structured and easy to understand.
    
    \item Comprehensiveness received the lowest average score (3.5), suggesting that while the tests were generally effective, they sometimes missed certain edge cases or exceptional conditions.
    
    \item The human-in-the-loop feature that allows refinement of block predictions was identified as particularly valuable, with evaluators noting that tests generated after prediction adjustment showed marked improvement in relevance scores (increasing from an average of 3.6 to 4.4).
    
    \item Evaluators noted that the tests reflected modern Flutter testing patterns and idioms, demonstrating the effectiveness of the RAG approach in incorporating framework-specific knowledge.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Special Use Cases}

To further evaluate the system's capabilities, we tested it against several special use cases that present unique challenges:

\subsubsection{Business Logic-Heavy Functions}

For functions implementing complex business rules, Test Genie achieved a 76% success rate in properly testing the rules, with human-adjusted predictions improving this to 88%. The system was particularly effective at identifying and testing validation rules, calculation routines, and state transitions.

\subsubsection{Widget Testing}

Widget testing presents unique challenges due to the need to understand UI component hierarchies and asynchronous behavior. Test Genie correctly generated widget tests with an initial success rate of 72%, improving to 81% after error correction. Human evaluators noted that the generated widget tests correctly employed appropriate Flutter testing patterns such as `pumpAndSettle()`, `findsOneWidget`, and `expectLater`.

\subsubsection{Asynchronous Code}

For code involving asynchronous operations (Future, Stream, async/await), Test Genie achieved an 84% final execution success rate, demonstrating effective handling of Flutter's asynchronous programming patterns. The system correctly generated tests using appropriate async testing patterns, including `expectLater` with Stream matchers and proper use of the `FakeAsync` utility.

\subsection{Accuracy Limitations}

Despite the overall positive results, several limitations were identified:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Complex State Management}: The system struggled with code involving sophisticated state management solutions like BLoC or Redux, achieving only 65% success rates for such components.
    
    \item \textbf{Platform-Specific Code}: Test cases for code with platform-specific implementations (using platform channels) had lower success rates (62%), as this requires specialized mocking techniques.
    
    \item \textbf{Implicit Dependencies}: Functions with many implicit dependencies that weren't clearly visible in the code itself posed challenges, requiring more human adjustment to generate effective tests.
    
    \item \textbf{Complex UI Interactions}: Tests involving complex gestures or multi-step UI interactions achieved lower success rates and often required manual refinement.
\end{itemize}

These limitations highlight areas where the system could be improved in future iterations, possibly through enhanced analysis of project-wide dependencies and more sophisticated modeling of state management patterns.

\section{Comparison with Other Approaches}

To contextualize the performance and capabilities of Test Genie, this section compares it with existing approaches to automated test generation. The comparison covers both traditional algorithmic approaches and other AI-based solutions available in the market or research literature.

    \item The business logic analysis capabilities of Test Genie distinguish it from other AI solutions that primarily focus on generating tests based solely on function signatures or documentation.
    
    \item The combination of error correction, human-in-the-loop refinement, and interactive visualization creates a more comprehensive workflow than other existing solutions.
    
    \item While Some solutions achieve slightly higher coverage in certain scenarios, Test Genie's tests tend to be more aligned with business requirements due to its explicit focus on business logic analysis.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance in Real-World Development Scenarios}

To evaluate the practical utility of Test Genie in real-world development scenarios, we conducted a small-scale study with a team of Flutter developers who integrated the system into their workflow for two weeks. Key observations included:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Developers reported a 62\% reduction in time spent writing tests compared to manual test authoring.
    
    \item The quality of tests improved over time as developers learned to refine block predictions effectively.
    
    \item The visualization of dependencies and block relationships was cited as particularly valuable for understanding project structure.
    
    \item Developers noted that the system was most effective for standard business logic and UI components, but still required significant human intervention for highly complex or unusual patterns.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Unique Value Proposition}

Based on the comparative analysis, Test Genie's unique value proposition can be summarized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Framework-Specific Intelligence}: Its specialized focus on Flutter enables generation of idiomatic, framework-appropriate tests.
    
    \item \textbf{Business Logic Focus}: The explicit analysis of business logic produces tests that validate behavior against requirements rather than simply mirroring implementation.
    
    \item \textbf{Interactive Refinement}: The human-in-the-loop approach allows for continuous improvement of test quality based on developer feedback.
    
    \item \textbf{Visual Understanding}: The dependency visualization helps developers comprehend code structure and relationships, adding value beyond mere test generation.
    
    \item \textbf{Validation Integration}: Built-in test validation ensures that generated tests are immediately functional.
\end{enumerate}

These advantages position Test Genie as a particularly valuable tool for Flutter development teams seeking to improve testing efficiency without sacrificing quality or control.

\section{Summary of Findings}

The evaluation of Test Genie reveals several important findings regarding its performance, accuracy, and comparative advantages:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Performance Scalability}: The system's performance scales linearly with code size ($O(LOC)$ for code splitting) and number of blocks ($O(b)$ for AI generation), making it suitable for projects of various sizes.
    
    \item \textbf{Test Generation Accuracy}: The system achieves nearly 90\% execution success rate after error correction, with coverage metrics comparable to or exceeding other automated testing approaches.
    
    \item \textbf{Human Evaluation}: Generated tests received particularly high ratings for readability (4.3/5) and relevance (3.9/5), indicating their practical utility in real development contexts.
    
    \item \textbf{Comparative Advantage}: Test Genie demonstrates unique strengths in framework-specific test generation, business logic analysis, and interactive refinement compared to both traditional and AI-based alternatives.
    
    \item \textbf{Practical Impact}: Initial real-world usage indicates significant time savings (62\%) for testing tasks, with quality improvements over time as users become familiar with the system.
\end{enumerate}

These findings indicate that Test Genie successfully addresses the core challenges identified in the problem statement, providing an effective solution for automated test generation in Flutter projects. The system meets all six user requirements defined in Chapter 3, with particularly strong performance in generating tests that accurately reflect business logic and validating their correctness.

While limitations exist, particularly for complex state management patterns and platform-specific code, the system's interactive design allows users to address these challenges through prediction refinement. The linear scaling characteristics of the core algorithms suggest that Test Genie will remain performant even as project sizes grow, though API call latency may become a limiting factor for very large projects.
